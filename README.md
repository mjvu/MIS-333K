# MIS-333K
This is a final project I completed for my MIS 333K class where my team and I created a website for a fictional bookstore in Visual Studios using C# and Azure.
Please note that my team was originally a group of 4, but due to unforeseen circumstances, my final team ended up being me and only one other person.
As a result, this project is only 50% completed as our professor stated since we were a group of 2, as long we each completed 25% we would be okay.
